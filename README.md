## Requirements

Using the best React practices you know, implement an application based on
the below requirements. 

1. A user should be able to input and submit a string of text to the app.
2. The app should maintain a list of strings.
  2.1. When a string is submitted, any leading and trailing whitespace should
       be removed.
  2.2. If the remaining string is at least 1 character long, then it should
       be stored in the app's list of strings.
  2.3. The element used for text input should be cleared if and only if a
       string is stored in the app's list of strings.
3. The app's list of strings should be rendered in alphanumerically sorted order
   under the elements used for input and submission.
4. Required `className` prop values for certain elements:
  4.1 Root element: "App".
  4.2 Element used for text input: "TextInput".
  4.3 Element used for text submission: "Submit".
  4.4 Parent element to rendered list: "List".
5. The application should be accessible and usable when using only a keyboard.
6. Do not add or change styles - this is a functionality-only exercise.



This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
